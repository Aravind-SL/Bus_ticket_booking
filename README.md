# Bus_ticket_booking
The "Online Bus Booking Application" is a web-based platform where users can search for and book bus tickets between cities. Registered users can view and manage their bookings on a personal dashboard, while admins can add, edit, or delete buses and manage bookings. Non-logged-in users can browse available buses and view relevant details.
